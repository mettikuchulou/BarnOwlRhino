# Rhino Gamepad Navigation Plugin

This plugin for Rhino, developed in C# using `RhinoCommon`, `RhinoWindows`, and `SharpDX.XInput` libraries, enables users to navigate Rhino viewports with a gamepad. The project is centered around improving accessibility and ease of use, offering a more intuitive way to interact with Rhino.

The codebase follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern, ensuring clean architecture and maintainability. While gamepad-based viewport navigation is fully implemented, creating a UI for executing Rhino commands is still a work in progress.

## Features
- Gamepad-based navigation through Rhino viewports.
- Accessibility and ease of use at the forefront.
- Built with the MVVM design pattern for better structure and scalability.

## Future Plans
- Adding a UI for gamepad control of Rhino commands.
- Expanding customization options for gamepad interaction.
- Making the project compatible with platforms other than Windows.

## Call for Collaboration
I’m eager for community support to help shape the future of this project! Whether it’s contributing to the UI development, enhancing gamepad controls, or extending compatibility to other platforms, your ideas and contributions are welcome.
